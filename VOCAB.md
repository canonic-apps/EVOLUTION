## Terms

### EVOLUTION

System app that crawls the CANONVERSE and generates comprehensive self-documentation of platform emergence.

### Configuration

A specific state of the CANONBASE at a point in time, characterized by axiom count, primitive count, and repository structure.

### Platform Emergence

The process by which individual components (LEDGER, CANON, MACHINE, LANGUAGE, VALIDATORS, APPSTORE, DOMAINS) composed into a unified platform.

### Proto-CANONIC

Work that preceded formal CANONIC but contained seeds of the paradigm. Examples: GenomicPython (2007), MammoChat (2017), Compiler Insight (2025).

### Soft BIG BANG

The genesis moment (2026-01-10, commit d578676) when the LEDGER was initialized, creating the singularity from which the CANONVERSE emerged. Marks start of v0.x private development phase.

### Hard BIG BANG

The v1.0 public launch. Requires v0.3 GATE: (1) DISCLOSURE complete, (2) DISTRIBUTED LEDGER operational, (3) LANGUAGE SPEC perfect. Regenerates virgin CANONVERSE from LANGUAGE spec into distributed ledger. **PENDING.**

### Transcript Crawling

The process of extracting events, decisions, and evidence from session transcripts to build deterministic documentation.

### Deterministic Replay

The property that EVOLUTION output can be reproduced from transcripts alone - transcripts are the source of truth.
